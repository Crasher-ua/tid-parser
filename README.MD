## Synopsis

Here we have TID parser. This is test program, which parses TID and stores results in DB. Initially it was made in February 2015 and it has awful quality. The code is bad, the technologies are old, but it works. This repository is supposed to make this project better.

Also currently it is not working during migration period. But it is expected.
